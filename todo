fix imps: imps using the spawn-in system get stuck in swoop animation for some reason.
this doesnt affect any maps retroactively since its a new feature. just dont use spawnflag 128 with them for now

certain monsters (death knight, undying) behave very oddly with disc of repulsion & weapon knockback effects.
blast death knight, kill him, and then his corpse will be thrown. blast undying and they can be killed by walking into them. something to do with mass?

finish reiver monster

make tomed altfire mode for meteor staff
