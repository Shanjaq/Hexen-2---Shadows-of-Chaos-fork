fix imps: imps using the spawn-in system get stuck in swoop animation for some reason.
this doesnt affect any maps retroactively since its a new feature. just dont use spawnflag 128 with them for now

finish reiver monster

make tomed altfire mode for meteor staff

skull wizards start floating after teleporting back in; present in uhexen2 progs as well (and assumably vanilla)

make bone ball turret aim at the floor if it hit the ceiling

make axe altfire useful + unique

think of better altfire for magic missiles - current is redundant

import ash statue death system & skull wizard resurrection system
